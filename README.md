###During this lesson and challenge we were asked to use javascript to build a website with the capability to connect and filter data from an existin json file. In addition to  filtering the json file, we designed a website to make the experience exciting and visually beautiful. This task was completed within a html file utilizing Bootstrap which provided the layout, font size and color, buttons, and input fields. To add charm and tie in a theme, we scraped an image and applied it to the design of the website.  

The javascript code, filtered the data by utilizing three functions tied together by an object known as "filters."  The object known as filters ensures the the data is transform apropriately to produce the correct result.  To ensure that these functions work in harmony, "filters" was chained within each funcion.  

Recommendation:
One should consider refactoring the code and instead of three functions write one function
